              <p>
                We will not transfer your personal data outside of the EU, except as set out in paragraph 6 above, for
                example if we utilise cloud-based platforms to store personal data, which may involve use of
                geographically distributed data centres.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                In the case of these extra-EU transfers, where the transfers are not to countries that provide an
                adequate level of protection, we will put in place appropriate safeguards to cover transfers of personal
                data including, for example, signing standard contractual clauses, relying on a Privacy Shield
                certification and/or data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission.

              <p>
                If there are any other circumstances which would require us to transfer personal data outside of the UK,
                we will seek your consent to transfer your personal data outside of the UK.
